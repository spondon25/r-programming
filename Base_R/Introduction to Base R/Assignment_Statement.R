##Assignment statement

#Assignment operators "<-" or "=" can be used to assign a value to a variable or a symbol (R object), and it is preferable to use "<-" as "=" has other uses.
# "<-" is only used to assign a value to a variable
#object <- value or value -> object

#Assign a value "4" to a variable "x"

x <- 4
ls()
#[1] "x"

#R function ls() provides the list of R objects in the current R session
