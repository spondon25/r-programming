#Vectors

#A variable or an R object with more than one value is known as a vector, and 
#in R, there are two types of vectors: atomic vectors and lists

#Atomic vector consists of the same type of elements, e.g. a vector with
#only character values

#List can have elements of di erent data types, i.e. one element of a list
#could be a numeric value, and the other could be a character values

#Scalar is a vector of length one, and an R object 
NULL
#is a vector of length zero
